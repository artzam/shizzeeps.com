<h1>About Shizzeeps</h1>

<h2>What's a Shizzeep?</h2>
<p>A shizzeep is a registered user of shizzow.com.</p>

<h2>What's a Shizzow?</h2>
<p>Shizzow.com is a location-based social web service built with the goal of helping you build quality relationships through face-to-face interaction. Shizzow provides the technology for you to notify your friends of your location, with as little effort as possible, so you can spend more time hanging out with your peeps and less time trying to coordinate bringing them together through phone, email, SMS and IM. (That is a direct quote stolen from shizzow.com.)</p>

<h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>
<p>You can see where all the shizzeeps are hanging out! All you have to do is log yourself in to shizzow with our handy dandy login form, and you will be presented with a list of places that have 2 or more shizzeeps in them. Mouse over the shizzeeps' shizzow names to see their real names and any shout messages they may have left.</p>

<p>But wait, that's not all! You can also leave an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ephemeral" title="Look it up">ephemeral</a> message for a place! You know how, on shizzow.com, you can't contact anyone? Well, now you can do that right here on shizzeeps.com. Your message will be viewable by all shizzeeps.com users, but it only lasts for about an hour. Want to ask if anyone/everyone is still there? Want to say 'hi' to the whole room at once? Now you can.</p>

<h2>Do You Offer Any Other Services?</h2>
<p>Why yes, as a matter of fact, we do. We have a Twitter.com service. Just follow us (@shizzeeps) on Twitter; we tweet every 15 minutes to let you know where all the hot spots are. Don't really care about hot spots in [name some place you don't live]? We've got you covered - just run a twitter search for a particular city and state like this: #shizzeepsPortlandOR</p>

<h2>How Can I Contact You</h2>
<p>You can ask questions, leave feedback and report issues on our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/shizzeeps" target="_blank">Get Satisfaction</a> site. Or, reply to or DM @shizzeeps on Twitter.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>SSL is next. We've got the certificate installed and will configure the site to use it real soon. After that, RSS. After that, maybe a blog. After that ... well, let us know what you'd like to see!</p>
