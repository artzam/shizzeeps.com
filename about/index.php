<h1>About Shizzeeps</h1>

<h2>What's a Shizzeep?</h2>
<p>A shizzeep is a registered user of shizzow.com.</p>

<h2>What's a Shizzow?</h2>
<p>Shizzow.com is a location-based social web service built with the goal of helping you build quality relationships through face-to-face interaction. Shizzow provides the technology for you to notify your friends of your location, with as little effort as possible, so you can spend more time hanging out with your peeps and less time trying to coordinate bringing them together through phone, email, SMS and IM. (That is a direct quote stolen from shizzow.com.)</p>

<h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>
<p>You can see where all the shizzeeps are hanging out, find your friends, find the hot spots, and maybe even make a new friend or two! All you have to do is log yourself in to shizzow with our handy dandy login form, and you will be presented with a list of top places that have shizzeeps in them. Mouse over the shizzeeps' shizzow names to see their real names and any shout messages they may have left. If you'd rather not log in, then you can see the top hangouts in Portland and Austin by clicking the 'PDX' and 'SXSW' buttons, respectively. No need to log in, but the messages feature is disabled.</p>

<p>But wait, that's not all! You can also leave an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ephemeral" title="Look it up">ephemeral</a> message for a place! You know how, on shizzow.com, you can't contact anyone? Well, now you can do that right here on shizzeeps.com. Your message will be viewable by all shizzeeps.com users, but it only lasts for about an hour. Want to ask if anyone/everyone is still there? Want to say 'hi' to the whole room at once? Now you can.</p>

<h2>I Have to Log In? I Don't Have to Log In? What?</h2>
<p>OK, here's the deal. Shizzeeps gets its data from shizzow.com. Shizzow imposes a limit on how many times we can get that
data every hour. The special PDX and SXSW pages are cached on the shizzeeps servers and updated every 11 minutes, so no matter how many times you hit Refresh, you won't get any new data until the 11 minutes are up. The main page, though, is not cached - that data comes directly from shizzow. For that, you have to use your own shizzow login and you are responsible for staying within your limit or not. It'll refresh itself every 15 minutes, which should be fine. If you keep hitting the Refresh button, you'll get up-to-the-second data, but you'll quickly use up your quota and then have to wait for it to reset. Sorry, but that's shizzow's policy. At least it's more lenient than twitter - shizzow gives us 250 API calls and twitter gives only 100. Make sense now? If it still seems fuzzy to you, hit the little Feedback tab on the right and let us know!</p>

<h2>Do You Offer Any Other Services?</h2>
<p>Why yes, as a matter of fact, we do. We have a Twitter.com service. Just follow us (@shizzeeps) on Twitter; we tweet every 15 minutes to let you know where all the hot spots are. Don't really care about hot spots in [name some place you don't live]? We've got you covered - just run a twitter search for a particular city and state like this: #shizzeepsPortlandOR</p>

<h2>How Will I Know When You Make Updates to Shizzeeps.com?</h2>
<p>Glad you asked. For that, follow @shizzeepsInfo on Twitter. @shizzeepsInfo only tweets every once in awhile to let you know of changes, updates, cool new features, etc. on shizzeeps.com.</p>

<h2>You Know What Would Make Shizzeeps Even Cooler?</h2>
<p>Unicorns? Rainbows? Beer? No? Tell us! You can ask questions, leave feedback and report issues on our <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/shizzeeps" target="_blank">Get Satisfaction</a> site. Or hit the little 'Feedback' tab on the right of every page. Or, reply to or DM @shizzeeps on Twitter.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>SSL is next. We've got the certificate installed and will configure the site to use it real soon. After that, RSS. After that, maybe a blog. After that ... well, let us know what you'd like to see!</p>
